        <strong>Rock climbing is an exhilarating and challenging sport that involves ascending a rock face using a combination  of physical strength, technique, and mental focus.

          <h2>1. Bouldering</h2>
            <em>Bouldering</em> is a type of rock climbing that involves climbing short, challenging routes <strong>without</strong> the use of ropes or harnesses. Climbers typically climb boulders that are no higher than <strong>20 feet</strong>, and they use crash pads to protect themselves in case of a fall. Bouldering requires a great deal of physical strength and technique, as climbers must rely on their <strong>balance, coordination, and finger strength</strong> to navigate the route.

          <h2>2. Sports Climbing</h2>
          <em>Sport climbing</em> is a type of rock climbing that involves climbing routes with pre-placed bolts for protection. Climbers clip their ropes into the bolts as they climb, allowing them to <strong>fall only a short distance</strong> if they slip or fall. Sport climbing is typically done on <strong>vertical or slightly overhanging rock faces</strong>, and it requires a great deal of <strong>endurance, strength, and mental focus</strong>.

          <h2>3. Traditional Climbing</h2>     
          <em>Traditional climbing</em>, also known as <em>trad climbing</em>, is a type of rock climbing that involves placing <strong>protective gear such as cams, nuts, and hexes</strong> into cracks in the rock as the climber ascends. Unlike sport climbing, trad climbing requires climbers to <strong>carry their own gear and place it themselves</strong>, which can be a time-consuming and challenging process. Trad climbing is typically done on longer routes that require multiple pitches, and it requires a great deal of <strong>technical skill, physical strength, and mental fortitude</strong>.

            <em><a href="https://films.nationalgeographic.com/free-solo">Free Solo</a></em> is a type of rock climbing that involves climbing <strong>without the use of ropes or protective gear</strong>. Free soloing is the most dangerous form of rock climbing, as any mistake or slip could result in a <strong>fatal fall</strong>. Free soloing requires a tremendous amount of <strong>physical and mental discipline</strong>, as well as an <strong>intimate knowledge</strong> of the rock face being climbed.
